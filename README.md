# News Aggregation System

This project is aimed at developing a **News Aggregation System** that will collect and display news articles from various sources. Currently, the focus is on researching and exploring the best methods for aggregating, filtering, and presenting news in a user-friendly way.

### Current Focus:
- **Research Work:** Exploring various techniques and approaches for aggregating news from multiple sources (e.g., RSS feeds, APIs).
- **Data Filtering:** Investigating how to effectively filter and categorize news articles based on topics, user preferences, and relevance.
- **Personalization:** Studying ways to create personalized news feeds that adapt to user preferences and interests.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Researching methods to keep the news feed updated in real-time without overwhelming the system.
  
### Research Areas:
- **News Aggregation Techniques:** Identifying the most efficient and scalable methods for gathering news from multiple sources.
- **Data Parsing and Filtering:** Researching algorithms and strategies for parsing, filtering, and presenting news data.
- **User Personalization Models:** Exploring machine learning and AI approaches to deliver personalized content to users.
- **Real-Time News Updates:** Investigating tools and technologies to handle real-time data processing for up-to-the-minute news delivery.

### Tech Stack (Planned):
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python (Flask/Django)
  - REST APIs for collecting and serving aggregated news articles.
- **Frontend:** React / Flutter (for mobile)
  - User interface for displaying news articles with search and filtering capabilities.
- **Database:** MongoDB / MySQL
  - Storing user preferences and article metadata.

### Documentation:
The **SDLC documentation** for the system has been completed and outlines the proposed structure and phases of the project once the research phase is done. The documentation follows the **Agile** methodology and will be updated iteratively as development progresses.
